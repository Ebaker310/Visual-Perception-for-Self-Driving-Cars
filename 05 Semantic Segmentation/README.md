Semantic Segmentation
---
The second most prevalent application of deep neural networks to self-driving is semantic segmentation, which associates image pixels with useful labels such as sign, light, curb, road, vehicle etc. The main use for segmentation is to identify the drivable surface, which aids in ground plane estimation, object detection and lane boundary assessment. Segmentation labels are also being directly integrated into object detection as pixel masks, for static objects such as signs, lights and lanes, and moving objects such cars, trucks, bicycles and pedestrians.
