Final Project
---

Welcome to the final assignment in this course. In this assignment, you will learn how to use the material so far to extract useful scene information to allow self-driving cars to safely and reliably traverse their environment.

In this assignment, you will:

- Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D.
- Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement lane estimation.
- Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D object detectors.
- Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.
