Visual Features - Detection, Description and Matching
---
Visual features are used to track motion through an environment and to recognize places in a map. This module describes how features can be detected and tracked through a sequence of images. Feature extraction is also fundamental to object detection and semantic segmentation in deep networks, and this module introduces some of the feature detection methods employed in that context as well.

Learning Objectives:
- Apply feature detection methods to driving images
- Distinguish between different feature detectors and descriptors
- Match image features using brute-force matching
- Perform improved image feature matching with maximum likelihood and KLT
- Formulate and solve visual odometry for a self-driving car dataset
- Improve VO performance through outlier rejection
