Applying Stereo Depth to a Driving Scenario
---
In this assignment, you will use what you've learned in the past Module to locate a car in a scene and estimate how far you are from it using a stereo camera model. This exercise gives you a brief introduction to using Python to implement what you've recently learned in order to find the distance to collision with an obstacle.

After this assignment you will be able to:

- Use OpenCV to complete standard vision tasks.
- Understand the process of obtaining depth from a pair of stereo images and their respective projection matrices.
- Understand the advantages of cross-correlation for localization of important information in an image.
